When I was searching for music on the WAR ROOM trailer, they immediately jumped in and sent me dozens of viable cues and even laid down numerous tracks to the video I sent them! Their helpful and knowledgeable staff are exceptional. I recommend Epic Music to anyone who is looking for amazing tracks that don’t sound or feel like your typical ‘stock music cue’.</p>
